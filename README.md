# Event-Connect
This project was my CMPG 212 Practical Exam. 
The project is for organizations to create events and users can register for the events. 
Organizations can track how many users/people are registered for the event, update event informaion or delete an event. 
Organizations and users can choose if they want to be premium members or not.
Users can also register for more than one event.
An invoice is created to the organization/user for the events they want to go to.
